This project consisted of three processes:
  1. Pull edge data from scanned handwriting samples
  2. Recursively fit cubic Bezier curves to edge data given some error threshold
  3. Display sentences using a VRML file to place letters
  
This repository contains the code for process 2 only because that was my contribution. If you would like all the code, I can provide it, however I will need to check with my collaborators first. You may contact me at joel.feske@gmail.com.
